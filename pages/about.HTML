            <h2>My Journey (So Far)</h2>
            <p>I started learning web development out of curiosity â€” and quickly realized how much I enjoy it. Since then,
                I've been deep-diving into front-end development, dabbling in AI tools, and working on personal projects to
                sharpen my skills.</p>
            <p>Right now, I'm focused on becoming a well-rounded developer by learning modern tools, building a solid
                portfolio, and contributing to creative, useful ideas.</p>
